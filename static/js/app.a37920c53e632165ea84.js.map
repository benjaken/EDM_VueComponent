<p>在多数业务情况下，EDM需要在设计区域内解决大量信息收纳的问题，因此在12栅格系统的基础上，我们将整个设计建议区域按照24等分的原则进行划分。</p> <p>划分之后的信息区块我们称之为“盒子”。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。“盒子”在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。</p> <h2 id=->概述</h2> <p>布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：</p> <ul> <li>通过<code>row</code>在水平方向建立一组<code>column</code>（简写col）</li> <li>你的内容应当放置于<code>col</code>内，并且，只有<code>col</code>可以作为<code>row</code>的直接元素</li> <li><code>col-xs</code>,<code>col-sm</code>,<code>col-md</code>,<code>col-lg</code>分别对应栅格中对应<code>小于768px</code>,<code>大于768px</code>,<code>大于992px</code>,<code>大于1200px</code>对于屏幕宽度的区分</li> <li>栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽d的列可以使用<code>.col-md-8</code>来创建</li> <li>如果一个<code>row</code>中的<code>col</code>总和超过24，那么多余的<code>col</code>会作为一个整体另起一行排列</li> </ul> <h2 id=->组件演示</h2> <div

<p>在多数业务情况下，EDM需要在设计区域内解决大量信息收纳的问题，因此在12栅格系统的基础上，我们将整个设计建议区域按照24等分的原则进行划分。</p> <p>划分之后的信息区块我们称之为“盒子”。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。“盒子”在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。</p> <h2 id=->概述</h2> <p>布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：</p> <ul> <li>通过<code>row</code>在水平方向建立一组<code>column</code>（简写col）</li> <li>你的内容应当放置于<code>col</code>内，并且，只有<code>col</code>可以作为<code>row</code>的直接元素</li> <li><code>col-xs</code>,<code>col-sm</code>,<code>col-md</code>,<code>col-lg</code>分别对应栅格中对应<code>小于768px</code>,<code>大于768px</code>,<code>大于992px</code>,<code>大于1200px</code>对于屏幕宽度的区分</li> <li>栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽d的列可以使用<code>.col-md-8</code>来创建</li> <li>如果一个<code>row</code>中的<code>col</code>总和超过24，那么多余的<code>col</code>会作为一个整体另起一行排列</li> </ul> <h2 id=->组件演示</h2> <div

的属性来产生不同的按钮样式，推荐顺序为：`type` -> `shape` -> `size` -> `loading` -> `disabled`\n\n  - 按钮的属性说明如下：\n\n  |属性 | 说明 | 类型 | 默认值\n  |-----|-----|-----|------\n  | type | 设置按钮类型，可选值为 `primary` `default` 或者不设 | Enum | undefined\n  | htmlType | 设置 `button` 原生的 `type` 值，可选值请参考 HTML标准 | Enum | `button`\n  | shape | 设置按钮形状，可选值为 `circle` `circle-outline` 或者不设 | Enum | undefined\n  | size | 设置按钮大小，可选值为 `xsmall` `small` `large` 或者不设 | Enum | undefined\n  | loading | 设置按钮载入状态，存在为 `true`，不存在为 `false`，或直接设置值，如：`loading=\"true\"` | Bool | false\n  | onClick | `click` 事件的 handler | Function | `function() {}`\n\n  - 除了上表中的属性，其它属性都会直接传到 `<button></button>`\n\n  ## 组件演示\n\n  <demo>\n    <example title=\"按钮类型\">\n      <v-button type=\"primary\">主按钮</v-button>\n      <!-- <v-button>次按钮</v-button> -->\n

划分之后的信息区块我们称之为“盒子”。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。“盒子”在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。\n\n  ## 概述\n\n  布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：\n\n  * 通过`row`在水平方向建立一组`column`（简写col）\n  * 你的内容应当放置于`col`内，并且，只有`col`可以作为`row`的直接元素\n  * `col-xs`,`col-sm`,`col-md`,`col-lg`分别对应栅格中对应`小于768px`,`大于768px`,`大于992px`,`大于1200px`对于屏幕宽度的区分\n  * 栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽d的列可以使用`.col-md-8`来创建\n  * 如果一个`row`中的`col`总和超过24，那么多余的`col`会作为一个整体另起一行排列\n\n  ## 组件演示\n  <demo>\n    <example title=\"基础布局\">\n      <div class=\"row\">\n
